  With the collapse of Denard scaling and Moore's Law, architects are transitioning towards multi-core systems. This paradigm shifts allows multiple cores on a single die, connected by high-bandwidth interconnects. 

  These interconnects are typically designed for high bandwidth but are elaborate NoCs, which often lead to nondeterministic latencies. Moreover, they are software-transparent, meaning application programmers cannot directly control these fabrics. Application programmers are left with shared memory as the primary means of communication. 

  However, shared memory suffers from nondeterministic latencies due to the cache hierarchy, TLB flushes, and cache pollution. This is especially problematic for latency-critical applications such as autonomous vehicles, drones, robotics, and augmented/virtual reality applications.

  In this paper, we present RVipc, a low-latency inter-core communication protocol for real-time systems. RVipc is designed for trusted environments, such as embedded systems.
  It provides a mechanism to synchronize and communicate between cores with low latency and predictable latency metrics.
